# COP 5536 Spring 2023

## Problem Description

GatorTaxi is an up-and-coming ride-sharing service. They get many ride requests every day and are
planning to develop new software to keep track of their pending ride requests.

A ride is identified by the following triplet:

**rideNumber**: unique integer identifier for each ride.  
**rideCost**: The estimated cost (in integer dollars) for the ride.  
**tripDuration**: the total time (in integer minutes) needed to get from pickup to destination.  
The needed operations are
1. **Print**(*rideNumber*) prints the triplet (rideNumber, rideCost, tripDuration).
2. **Print**(*rideNumber1, rideNumber2*) prints all triplets (rx, rideCost, tripDuration) for which
rideNumber1 <= rx <= rideNumber2.
3. **Insert** (*rideNumber, rideCost, tripDuration*) where rideNumber differs from existing ride
numbers.
4. **GetNextRide**() When this function is invoked, the ride with the lowest rideCost (ties are broken by
selecting the ride with the lowest tripDuration) is output. This ride is then deleted from the data
structure.
5. **CancelRide**(*rideNumber*) deletes the triplet (rideNumber, rideCost, tripDuration) from the data
structures, can be ignored if an entry for rideNumber doesnâ€™t exist.
6. **UpdateTrip**(*rideNumber, new_tripDuration*) where the rider wishes to change the destination, in
this case,
a) if the new_tripDuration <= existing tripDuration, there would be no action needed.
b) if the existing_tripDuration < new_tripDuration <= 2*(existing tripDuration), the driver will
cancel the existing ride and a new ride request would be created with a penalty of 10 on
existing rideCost . We update the entry in the data structure with (rideNumber, rideCost+10,
new_tripDuration)
c) if the new_tripDuration > 2*(existing tripDuration), the ride would be automatically declined
and the ride would be removed from the data structure.

## Input Format

Input test data will be given in the following format.

**Insert**(*rideNumber, rideCost, tripDuration*)  
**Print**(*rideNumber*)  
**Print** (*rideNumber1,rideNumber2*)  
**UpdateTrip**(*rideNumber, newTripDuration*)  
**GetNextRide**()  
**CancelRide**(*rideNumber*)  

**Example 1:**


Insert(25,98,46)  
GetNextRide()  
GetNextRide()  
Insert(42,17,89)  
Insert(9,76,31)  
Insert(53,97,22)  
GetNextRide()  
Insert(68,40,51)  
GetNextRide()  
Print(1,100)  
UpdateTrip(53,15)  
Insert(96,28,82)  
Insert(73,28,56)  
UpdateTrip(9,88)  
GetNextRide()  
Print(9)  
Insert(20,49,59)  
Insert(62,7,10)  
CancelRide(20)  
Insert(25,49,46)  
UpdateTrip(62,15)  
GetNextRide()  
Print(1,100)  
Insert(53,28,19)  
Print(1,100)  

The output for this would be:

(25,98,46)  
No active ride requests  
(42,17,89)  
(68,40,51)  
(9,76,31),(53,97,22)  
(73,28,56)  
(0,0,0)  
(62,17,15)  
(25,49,46),(53,97,15),(96,28,82)  
Duplicate RideNumber
